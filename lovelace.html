            <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 
                    10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English 
                    mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on 
                    Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose 
                    computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to 
                    recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure 
                    calculation, and created the first algorithm intended to be
                    carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often 
                    regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a
                    "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.
                    Ada Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord
                    Byron, and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke ("Annabella"), 
                    Lady Wentworth. All of Byron's other children were born out 
                    of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a 
                    month after Ada was born and left England forever four
                    months later, eventually dying of disease in the Greek War
                    of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother 
                    remained bitter towards Lord Byron and promoted Ada's
                    interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent
                    her from developing what she saw as the insanity seen in her
                    father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this 
                    (and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at
                    her request). Often ill, she spent most of her childhood 
                    sick. Ada married William King in 1835. King was made Earl 
                    of Lovelace in 1838, and she became Countess of Lovelace.

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Byron expected his baby to be a "glorious boy" and was 
                    disappointed when his wife gave birth to a girl.[9] Augusta
                    was named after Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was
                    called "Ada" by Byron himself.[10]On 16 January 1816 Ada's 
                    mother, Annabella, at Byron's behest, left for her parents'
                    home at Kirkby Mallory, taking one-month-old Ada with her.
                    [9] Although English law at the time gave fathers full 
                    custody of their children in cases of separation, Byron made
                    no attempt to claim his parental rights[11] but did request
                    that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.[12] On
                    21 April Byron signed the Deed of Separation, although very
                    reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.[13]
                    Aside from an acrimonious separation, Annabella continually
                    made allegations about Byron's immoral behaviour throughout
                    her life.[14]
                    This set of events made Ada famous in Victorian society. 
                    Byron did not have a relationship with his daughter, and 
                    never saw her again. He died in 1824 when she was eight 
                    years old. Her mother was the only significant parental 
                    figure in her life.[15] Ada was not shown the family 
                    portrait of her father (covered in green shroud) until her 
                    twentieth birthday.[16] Her mother became Baroness Wentworth
                    in her own right in 1856.
                    Annabella did not have a close relationship with the young
                    Ada and often left her in the care of her own mother Judith,
                    Hon. Lady Milbanke who doted on her grandchild. However,
                    because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured 
                    the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child
                    acting as mitigation—Annabella had to present herself as a 
                    loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing
                    anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about Ada's welfare, with a
                    cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to 
                    use them to show maternal concern.[17] In one letter to Lady
                    Milbanke, she referred to Ada as "it": "I talk to it for 
                    your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when 
                    you have it under your own."[18] In her teenage years, 
                    several of her mother's close friends watched Ada for any
                    sign of moral deviation. Ada dubbed these observers the 
                    "Furies" and later complained they exaggerated and invented
                    stories about her.[19]
                    Ada was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age
                    of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her 
                    vision.[10] In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of 
                    measles. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly
                    a year, which may have extended her period of disability. 
                    By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite being 
                    ill Ada developed her mathematical and technological skills.
                    At age 12 this future "Lady Fairy", as Charles Babbage 
                    affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly.
                    Ada went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with 
                    imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828,
                    was to construct wings. She investigated different material
                    and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings:
                    paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the 
                    anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between
                    the wings and the body. She decided to write a book,
                    Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings.
                    She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a 
                    compass, to "cut across the country by the most direct road"
                    , so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys.
                    Her final step was to integrate steam with the "art of flying".

                <em>Ada, age four.</em>
                <h3>Adult Life</h3>
                <p>
                   Lovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville,
                   who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a 
                   strong respect and affection for Somerville,[22] and they 
                   corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the
                   scientists Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles
                   Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. 
                   She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen "and 
                   became a popular belle of the season" in part because of 
                   her "brilliant mind."[23] By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court
                   and started attending various events. She danced often and
                   was able to charm many people, and was described by most 
                   people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse, Byron's
                   friend, described her as "a large, coarse-skinned young woman
                   but with something of my friend's features, particularly the 
                   mouth".[24] This description followed their meeting on 24 
                   February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that 
                   she did not like him, probably because of the influence of 
                   her mother, which led her to dislike all of her father's
                   friends. This first impression was not to last, and they 
                   later became friends.[25]
                   On 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming
                   Lady King.[26] 
                   They had three homes: Ockham Park, Surrey, a Scottish estate
                   on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire, and a house in London. They
                   spent their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near 
                   Porlock Weir, Somerset. The Manor had been built as a hunting
                   lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for 
                   their honeymoon. It later became their summer retreat and 
                   was further improved during this time. From 1845 the family's
                   main house was East Horsley Towers, rebuilt in the Victorian
                   Gothic fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament,
                   Charles Barry.[27][28]
                   They had three children: Byron (born 12 May 1836); Anne 
                   Isabella (called Annabella; born 22 September 1837); and 
                   Ralph Gordon (born 2 July 1839). Immediately after the birth 
                   of Annabella, Lady King experienced "a tedious and suffering
                   illness, which took months to cure."[25] Ada was a descendant
                   of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838, her husband was 
                   made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham,[29] meaning Ada
                   became the Countess of Lovelace. In 1843–44, Ada's mother 
                   assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada's children
                   and to act as a "moral" instructor for Ada.[30] He quickly
                   fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated 
                   affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never
                   act in an "unbecoming" manner. When it became clear that
                   Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.[31]

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout her illnesses, she continued her education.[40] 
                    Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity
                    of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada 
                    was taught mathematics from an early age. She was 
                    schooled in mathematics and science by William Frend, 
                    William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted researcher
                    and scientific author of the 19th century. One of her later
                    tutors was the mathematician and logician Augustus De
                    Morgan. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical
                    abilities began to emerge,[23] and her interest in
                    mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a
                    letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her 
                    daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become 
                    "an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate
                    eminence".[41]
                    Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating 
                    poetry and science. While studying differential calculus, 
                    she wrote to De Morgan:
                    <strong>“I may remark that the curious transformations many
                        formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner
                        apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly 
                        dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief 
                        difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies.
                        I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one 
                        reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and
                        the next minute in a form most dissimilar”.</strong>
                </p>
                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in 
                    scientific developments and fads of the day, including
                    phrenology[48] and mesmerism.[49] After her work with 
                    Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. 
                    In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her
                    desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain 
                    gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings ("a calculus 
                    of the nervous system").[50] She never achieved this, 
                    however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a 
                    long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, 
                    about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into
                    this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew
                    Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical 
                    experiments.[51] In the same year, she wrote a review of a
                    paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on 
                    Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to
                    have progressed past the first draft.[52] In 1851, the year 
                    before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning
                    "certain productions" she was working on regarding the 
                    relation of maths and music.[53]</p>
                <h3>First Computer Program</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the 
                    University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi 
                    Menabrea, a young Italian engineer, and the future Prime 
                    Minister of Italywrote up Babbage's lecture in French, and 
                    this transcript was subsequently published in the 
                    Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842. 
                    Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada 
                    Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She 
                    then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to 
                    the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a 
                    year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These 
                    notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were
                    then published in Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the 
                    initialism AAL.
                    Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to
                    G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical
                    Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered the 
                    first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for 
                    implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often 
                    been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.
                    [67][68] The engine was never completed so her program was
                    never tested.[69]
                    In 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's
                    notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished. The 
                    engine has now been recognised as an early model for a 
                    computer and her notes as a description of a computer and
                    software.[62]
                </p>
                <h3>Beyond Numbers</h3>
                <p>In her notes, Lovelace emphasised the difference between the 
                    Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, 
                    particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems
                    of any complexity.[70]She realised the potential of the 
                    device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her 
                    notes, she wrote:
                    [The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides
                    number, were objects
                    found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed 
                    by those of the abstract science of operations, and which 
                    should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of
                    the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...
                    Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of 
                    pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical 
                    composition were susceptible of such expression and 
                    adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and 
                    scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or
                    extent.[71][72]
                    This analysis was an important development from previous 
                    ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and 
                    anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred 
                    years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes 
                    Lovelace's insight regarding the application of computing to
                    any process based on logical symbols to an observation about
                    textiles: "When she saw some mechanical looms that used
                    punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns, it 
                    reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to 
                    make calculations."[73] This insight is seen as significant
                    by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well
                    as the programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan 28
                    has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical 
                    Engine.

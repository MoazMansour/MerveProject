            <p> <strong>Ernest Gary Gygax</strong>  (July 27, 1938 – March 4, 2008) was an American game designer and author best known for co-creating the pioneering role-playing game <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> (D&amp;D) with Dave Arneson.
                Gygax has been described as the father of D&amp;D.</p>
            <p> In the 1960s, Gygax created an organization of wargaming clubs and founded the Gen Con gaming convention.
                In 1971, he helped develop <em>Chainmail</em>, a miniatures wargame based on medieval warfare. He co-founded the company Tactical Studies Rules (TSR, Inc.) with childhood friend Don Kaye in 1973.
                The following year, he and Arneson created D&amp;D, which expanded on Gygax's Chainmail and included elements of the fantasy stories he loved as a child. In the same year, he founded <em>The Dragon</em>, a magazine based around the new game.
                In 1977, Gygax began work on a more comprehensive version of the game, called <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Gygax designed numerous manuals for the game system,
                as well as several pre-packaged adventures called "modules" that gave a person running a D&amp;amp;D game (the "Dungeon Master") a rough script and ideas on how to run a particular gaming scenario.
                In 1983, he worked to license the D&amp;D product line into the successful D&amp;D cartoon series.</p>
            <p> After leaving TSR in 1985 over issues with its new majority owner, Gygax continued to create role-playing game titles independently, beginning with the multi-genre Dangerous Journeys in 1992.
                He designed another gaming system called <em>Lejendary Adventure</em>, released in 1999. In 2005, Gygax was involved in the <em>Castles &amp; Crusades</em> role-playing game, which was conceived as a hybrid between
                the third edition of D&amp;D and the original version of the game conceived by Gygax.</p>
            <p> Gygax was married twice and had six children. In 2004, Gygax suffered two strokes, narrowly avoided a subsequent heart attack, was then diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and died in March 2008.</p>


            <h2><em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and Hollywood</h2>
            <p> The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set</em>, released in 1977, was a simplified variation of the original D&amp;D geared towards younger players and edited by J. Eric Holmes.
                But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D&amp;D, <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> (AD&amp;D). <em>The Monster Manual</em>, released later that year,
                became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD&amp;D rules were not compatible with those of D&amp;D, and as a result, D&amp;D and AD&amp;D became distinct product lines.
                Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D&amp;D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD&amp;D books, claiming it was a new and different property.
                In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD&amp;D products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.</p>
            <p> Gygax wrote the AD&amp;D hardcovers <em>Players Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide, Monster Manual</em>, and <em>Monster Manual II</em>. Gygax also wrote or co-wrote numerous AD&amp;D and basic D&amp;D adventure modules,
                including The <em>Keep on the Borderlands, Tomb of Horrors, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, The Temple of Elemental Evil, The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun, Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure,
                Isle of the Ape</em>, and all seven of the modules later combined into Queen of the Spiders. In 1980, Gygax's long-time campaign setting of Greyhawk was published in the form of the World of Greyhawk Fantasy World Setting folio,
                which was expanded in 1983 into the World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting boxed set. Sales of the D&amp;D game reached US$8.5 million in 1980. Gygax also provided assistance on the
                Gamma World science fantasy role-playing game in 1981 and co-authored the Gamma World adventure <em>Legion of Gold</em>.</p>
            <p> In 1979, a Michigan State University student, James Dallas Egbert III, allegedly disappeared into the school's steam tunnels while playing a live-action version of D&amp;D.
                In fact, Egbert was discovered in Louisiana several weeks later, but negative mainstream media attention focused on D&amp;D as the cause. In 1982, Patricia Pulling's son killed himself.
                Blaming D&amp;D for her son's suicide, Pulling formed an organization named B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons &amp; Dragons) to attack the game and the company that produced it.
                Gygax defended the game on a segment of 60 Minutes, which aired in 1985. When death threats started arriving at the TSR office, Gygax hired a bodyguard.
                Despite the negative publicity, or perhaps because of it, TSR's annual D&amp;D sales increased in 1982 to US$16 million, and in January 1983,
                The <em>New York Times</em> speculated that D&amp;D might become "the great game of the 1980s" in the same manner that Monopoly was emblematic of the Great Depression.</p>
            <p> Brian Blume persuaded Gygax to allow Brian's brother Kevin to purchase Melvin Blume's shares. This gave the Blume brothers a controlling interest, and by 1981,
                Gygax and the Blumes were increasingly at loggerheads over management of the company. Gygax's frustrations at work, and increased prosperity from his generous royalty cheques brought a number of changes to his personal life.
                He and Mary Jo had been active members of the local Jehovah's Witnesses, but others in the congregation already felt uneasy about Gygax's smoking and drinking;
                his connection to the "satanic" game of D&amp;D caused enough friction that the Gygaxes finally disassociated themselves from Jehovah's Witnesses.
                Mary Jo, continuing to resent the amount of time her husband spent "playing games", had begun to drink excessively, and the couple argued frequently.
                Gygax, who had started smoking marijuana when he lost his insurance job in 1970, started to use cocaine, and had a number of extramarital affairs.
                Finally in 1983, the two had an acrimonious divorce.</p>
            <p> At the same time, the Blumes, wanting to get Gygax out of Lake Geneva so they could manage the company without his "interference", split TSR Hobbies into TSR, Inc., and TSR Entertainment, Inc.
                Gygax became the President of TSR Entertainment, Inc., and the Blumes sent him to Hollywood to develop TV and movie opportunities.
                He became co-producer of the licensed D&amp;D cartoon series for CBS, which led its time slot for two years.</p>
            <p> Gygax, newly single, took advantage of his time on the West Coast, renting an immense mansion, increasing his cocaine use, and spending time with several young starlets.</p>

                        how small or trivial the issue. Oh, and they WILL drag along the entire party on every measly little quest.
                        They're also likely to try and sacrifice their own lives to save someone else's. This alignment is essentially selflessness
                        in a nutshell.</p></td>

                        ever have to deal with. Basically, they will those they think are really in need, but won't waste time
                        on small things. Bill needs rare medicine for his terminal disease? Count them in! Billy lost his teddy

                        torture and murder to bring justice or achieve their utopia. Gotta defeat the horrible dragon or giant! Level a city in the process?
                        Whatever! At least they got the job done. They'll never intentionally hurt anybody, just be careful not to get caught

                        they'll help bad guys too. Indeed, these people believe in keeping the balance to the fanatical extreme and will assist
                        anyone in a weaker position, be it a demon or a saint. They don't care for backgrounds, only that nobody gets stronger

                        for nothing but themselves, only they still have enough conscience not to be evil about it. Or they're just too lazy
                        Despite what some may think, these people will never turn on you or try to harm you, but neither will they ever lift
                        a finger to help you unless it also helps themselves. They just can't be arsed either way. Completely trustworthy.

                        can be loving, caring friends who risk their lives to save you, the next they'll try and stab you in the neck. You read that right,

                        to follow, except that they are all about punishing everybody who would infringed upon these. Bureaucrats, gangsters,
                        paladins, the Inquisition, they're all like this. Perfectly fine folks until you cross the line, and then they'll hunt you to

            <h2>The "Father" of Roleplaying Games</h2>
            <p> Gygax continued to work on <em>Lejendary Adventures</em> which he believed was his best work. However, sales were below expectation.</p>
            <p> On June 11, 2001, Stephen Chenault and Davis Chenault of Troll Lord Games announced that Gygax would be writing books for their company Troll Lord Games.
                Gygax's early work for Troll Lord included a series of hardcover books that eventually came to be called "Gygaxian Fantasy Worlds"; the first was <em>The Canting Crew</em> (2002), a look at the roguish underworld.
                He also wrote <em>World Builder</em> (2003) and <em>Living Fantasy</em> (2003), generic game design books usable in many different settings. After the first four books in the series,
                Gygax stepped down from writing and took on an advisory role, though the series logo still carried his name. Troll Lord also published a few adventures as a result of their partnership with Gygax,
                including <em>The Hermit</em> (2002) an adventure intended for d20 and also for <em>Lejendary Adventures</em>.</p>
            <p> By 2002, Gygax had given Christopher Clark of Hekaforge an encyclopaedic 72,000-word text describing the Lejendary Earth.
                Clark split the manuscript up into five books and expanded it, with each of the final books coming to about 128,000 words, giving Hekaforge a third <em>Lejendary Adventures</em> line to supplement the core rules and adventures.
                Hekaforge managed to publish the first two of those Lejendary Earth sourcebooks, <em>Gazetteer</em> (2002) and <em>Noble Kings and Great Lands</em> (2003), but by 2003 the small company was having financial difficulties.
                Clark to ask Troll Lord Games to become an "angel" investor by publishing the three remaining <em>Lejendary Adventures</em> books.</p>
            <p> On October 9, 2001, Necromancer Games announced that they would be publishing a d20 version of <em>Necropolis</em>, an adventure originally planned by Gygax for
                New Infinities Productions and later printed in 1992 as a Mythus adventure by GDW; Gary Gygax's <em>Necropolis</em> was published a year later.</p>
            <p> Gygax also performed voiceover narration for cartoons and video games. In 2000, he voiced his own cartoon self for an episode of Futurama, "Anthology of Interest I"
                that also included the voices of Al Gore, Stephen Hawking and Nichelle Nichols. Gygax also performed as a guest Dungeon Master in the Delera's Tomb quest series
                of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online: Stormreach</em>.</p>
            <p> During his time with TSR, Gygax had often mentioned the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the centre of his own home campaign.
                But despite all of his written output over the previous 30 years, Gygax had never published details of the castle.
                In 2003, Gygax announced that he was again partnering with Rob Kuntz to publish the original and previously unpublished details of Castle Greyhawk and the City of Greyhawk in 6 volumes,
                although the project would use the rules for <em>Castles and Crusades</em> rather than D&amp;D. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum:
                "I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle'
                that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work.
                Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels.
                So the end result will be what is essentially the best of our old work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding...
                I hope." Since Wizards of the Coast, which had bought TSR in 1997, still owned the rights to the name "Greyhawk", Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to "Castle Zagyg", a reverse homophone of his own name,
                and also changed the name of the nearby city to "Yggsburgh", a play on his initials "E.G.G."</p>
            <p> The scale of the project was enormous: By the time Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on their original home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of cunningly complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps.
                This, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city, would clearly be too much to fit into the proposed 6 volumes.
                Gygax decided he would compress the castle dungeons into 13 levels, the size of his original Castle Greyhawk in 1973 by amalgamating the best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes.
                However, neither Gygax nor Kuntz had kept careful or comprehensive plans. Because they had often made up details of play sessions on the spot, they usually just scribbled a quick map as they played,
                with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps. These sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that the two could ensure their independent work would dovetail.
                All of these old notes now had to be deciphered, 25-year-old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room, and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece. Recreating the city too would be a challenge.
                Although Gygax still had his old maps of the original city, all of his previously published work on the city was owned by WotC, so he would have to create most of the city from scratch while still maintaining the "look and feel" of his original.</p>
            <p> Due to creative differences, Kuntz backed out of the project, but created an adventure module that would be published at the same time as Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own,
                but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later.
                Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day.
                Finally in 2005, <em>Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh</em>, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published <em>Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau</em> (2005),
                the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: <em>The East Marks Gazetteer</em> (2007).</p>
            <p> That same year, Gygax was diagnosed with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%.
                With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal.
                In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.</p>
            <p> It wasn't until 2008 that Gygax was able to finish the second volume of six volumes, <em>Castle Zagyg: The Upper Works</em>, which described details of the castle above ground.
                The next two volumes were supposed to detail the dungeons beneath Castle Zagyg. However, before they could be written, Gygax died in March 2008.
                Three months after his death, Gygax Games – a new company formed by Gary's widow, Gail – withdrew all of the Gygax licenses from Troll Lord, and also from Hekaforge.</p>
